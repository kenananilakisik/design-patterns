Second question, as it is stated in the question description as well, using abstract factory
methods made it easy to create specialized nodes and to perform additional operations. Code now can be
changed and the existing code will still run without needing any changes.

    For 3rd question, having the abstract factory class which I created for question 2 made it easier
to count the number of instances of each type of node, i.e., NodeFactory enabled me to keep track of
the instances of the objects that are being instanciated at runtime.

    For 4th question using Singleton design pattern allowed me to make a class in my design such that 
only one instance of that class can be created which is very important in case there are classes in
a design that should only have one instance.
